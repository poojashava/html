<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Sai Pooja, and I’m super excited to invite you to my birthday celebration! I’m a student at CMR, currently in
   the CSM program, and I love exploring fun challenges and spending time with the people I care about. This birthday is 
   extra special to me, and I’d love for you to be part of the joy and laughter.</p>

<p>I’m lucky to have such amazing parents, Natraj and Prashanthi, who always make every moment feel special. With their
   love and support, birthdays have always been filled with warmth, smiles, and unforgettable memories. And of course, my
    awesome sibling Shiva Sai adds to all the fun and makes every celebration even more exciting!</p>

<p>So come join us for a day full of happiness, cake, and celebration! Your presence will mean the world to me, and 
  I can’t wait to make more beautiful memories together!</p>
